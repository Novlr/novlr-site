						<h2>Writing is for life, not just for Christmas</h2>
						<p>But Christmas is a good place to start. One of our supporters asked if she could buy Lifetime Novlr for her friend for Christmas. So we made up a little package for her friend that included a handmade card, letter and an uber official "gift card". If you want to do the same, once you've bought it please email <a href="mailto:hello@novlr.org">hello@novlr.org</a> and let us know who it is for. Do it - be the best present-giver this Christmas.</p>

					<h3>Boring disclaimer-y bits</h3>
					<div class="fontsmall">
					<p>Pre-ordering Novlr is a mix of exciting opportunity and a little bit of a gamble. </p>

					<p>Much like our intention on Kickstarter, we will be using the funds to build up the functionality of Novlr until it is ready to come out of beta. Once out of beta we will begin to charge new users of Novlr but you will not have to pay. This means you get access to the best writing tool that exists for years and years to come for a small amount of money.</p>

					<p>We are doing this in good faith. We will spend your money on nothing but building Novlr, but as we stated in our Kickstarter, there is the chance that something may happen that causes Novlr not to happen and we won't be in a position to refund you. Therein lies the gamble. However, we hope that with the year of work we've already invested behind us and the incredible product that is already out there in our beta you can see that this is something we are determined to deliver on.</p>

					<p>So by preordering Novlr you are making Novlr happen. And we salute you for it.</p>

					<h3>What am I buying when I preorder Novlr?</h3>
					<p>You'll be buying an account on Novlr that you will be able to access for as long as Novlr continues to exist, with all the features we add over time. This will bring you much happiness and joy.</p>

					<h3>What if I change my mind and want a refund?</h3>
					<p>We don't want anyone to have pre-ordered Novlr and then decide it was a mistake and be stuck with that decision. So we will refund you completely for whatever reason up to seven days after purchase. As we've explained above we will be looking to spend the pre-order money on getting Novlr built so unfortunately after those seven days we won't be able to offer a refund. </p>
